# ARCHEthic Improvement Proposals (AEIPs)

ARCHEthic Improvement Proposals (AEIPs) describe standards for the ARCHEthic network, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and any standards. 

**Before you initiate a pull request**, please read the [AEIP-1]() process document.

Once your first PR is merged, this will be merged into a draft AEIPs. 

## Project Goal

The ARCHEthic Improvement Proposals repository exists as a place to share concrete proposals with potential users of the proposal and the ARCHEthic community at large.
