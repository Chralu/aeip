# Archethic Improvement Proposals (AEIPs)

Archethic Improvement Proposals (AEIPs) describe standards for the Archethic network, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and any standards. 

**Before you initiate a pull request**, please read the [AEIP-1](AEIP-1.md) process document.

Once your first PR is merged, this will be merged into a draft AEIPs. 

## Project Goal

The Archethic Improvement Proposals repository exists as a place to share concrete proposals with potential users of the proposal and the Archethic community at large.

With those document we aim to create standards for Archethic network implementation and applications and to document them in a high quality and implementable way.
