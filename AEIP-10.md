## Abstract

Web3 technology brought the usage of digital assets as a way to express our needs of transfers and associations into shared goals.
Social, financials decentralized economics activities are now possible and express a way of freedom by building transferables relationships.

[Decentralized Society](https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=132088086121078005091084073112109108125018001047091022000126083006124121094095123126045055003101126027111029072101098090069064009041023059084025027064118112120103091072003004001116020091083097006084086097119102120065084123008087120094106091015119066093&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE)
describe the concepts of Soul Bounded Tokens (SBT). These are non transferables tokens and are the keys to bring trust in networks to ensure origin and reputation of digital entities.
Parties("souls" & communities) in DeSoc (Decentralized Society) allow to create goods and intelligence.

By "soul" we mean any wallet/account holding non-transferable(but possibily revocable by the issuer) token.

Therefore, SBT can be seen as affiliation, membership or credentials. They can be self-certified but the power comes when they become attested or issued by third-parties (companies, individuals, institutions).

For example, Archethic Foundation could create a SBT to certify pre-investements of the first miners or signer of the [digital human rights](https://mainnet.archethic.net/explorer/transaction/0000C13373C96538B468CCDAB8F95FDC3744EBFA2CD36A81C3791B2A205705D9C3A2).

Furthermore, Blockchains technologies are great to trace the time a particular assets was created, for example a time when a work from a particular NFT was made.
But SBT enables to trace the social provenance of this work.

DAO & OnChain governance could rely on SBTs to give more power to Souls holding more reputable SBTs (Archethic On-Chain Code Proposal Voting), or issuing proof of personhood, etc..
Indeed, proof of personhoop (PoP) could relies on SBT & Biometric to deliver uniqueness tokens.

On the other hand, revocables SBT can be useful in the case of representation of SBT as uncollateralized lending because the loans and credit are based on the reputation of the soul and could be revocable,
like a non-seizable repuration collateral until they repay or give proof of payment.

While being nice, SBT still needs to solve some challenges, particurly privacy. For this reason there is multiple solutions:
- Storing hash on-chain, with plain data stored off-chain
- Usage of Zero-Knowledge proof protocols
- Leverage [W3C Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)


This document is targetting the usage of SBT and its implementation on the Archethic's blockchain.
This is based on the [token standard AEIP](https://github.com/archethic-foundation/aeip/blob/main/AEIP-2.md) and also on the [UTXO's hooks AEIP](https://github.com/archethic-foundation/aeip/blob/main/AEIP-5.md).

## Specification

To be able to create a new SBT, the `token` transaction should be changed to support a new type of token: "soul-bounded"
```json
{
   "type": "soul-bounded",
   "AEIP": [2, 10]
}
```

The token will leverage the UTXO's hooks/condition to prevent any further usage of the token by creating spending conditions of this asset.
```jsonc
//Example of unspent output generated by the token transaction
{
   from: "0faa.....abC", // address of the token (in this case the genesis address)
   amount: 100_000_000, // 1 in 10e8
   condition: "genesis_address(transaction.address) == '0faa.....abC'" // This will prevent any transfer except from the issuer
}
```

## Revocability

While recovability is optional, few strategies can be implemented according of the usage and the complexity involved.

1. Expiration date

A simple solution for the issuer would be to assign an expiration date for the token. 
Hence application can rely on this attestation to check the validity of the SBT.

```json
{
  "type": "soul-bounded",
  "AEIP": [2, 10],
  "properties": {
    "expirationDate": "2024-01-01"  
  }
}

```

After some time, the issuer might decide to renew the SBT based on the claims of the receiver(ie. financial statements, administrative information updates, etc.)

2. Smart Contract / TransactionChain

A smart contract or a transaction chain can reference the lifecycle of a SBT, allowing or disallowing the usage of a SBT.
The UTXO's hook can be leveraged to send back the SBT to the issuer if the eligibility is not matched for any receiver's transaction.

```jsonc
{
  "type": "soul-bounded",
  "AEIP": [2, 10],
  "properties": {
    "eligibilityContract": "0fa....2b0" // Address of the smart contract chain attesting the eligibility
  },
  "hooks": "if getTransaction('0fa....2b0').content != "eligible" do # In that case the smart contract is the SBT's token transaction chain
    add_token_transfer(to: "0faa.....2b0", amount: 100_000_000, token_address: "0faa....2b0")
  end"
}
```
